# Responsiveness Fix for Nutrix App

## Tasks
- [x] Modify App.tsx to make layout responsive: full screen on mobile, phone frame on desktop
- [x] Test responsiveness on different screen sizes (code changes implemented)
- [x] Verify components display correctly in full screen mode (components already use responsive classes)

## Notes
- Current issue: Fixed 375px x 667px container prevents responsiveness
- Solution: Use responsive Tailwind classes to show full screen on mobile, phone frame on larger screens
- Components already use responsive classes, just need container adjustment
